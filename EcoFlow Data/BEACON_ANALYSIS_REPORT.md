## Beacon Types Discovered

### 1. 0xC5C5 Beacon (Manufacturer Data)

**From btsnoop (app capture):**
```
Total Length: 28 bytes of manufacturer data
Pattern: C5 13 8D 48 35 33 30 35 13 00 37 36 35 30 0D 0C 09 45 46 2D 52 33 35 30 31 33 35 00

Breakdown:
Byte  0-1:  C5 13         - Mfg ID (0xC513, not 0xC5C5!)
Byte  2:    8D (141)      - Battery related? (141-66=75%)
Byte  3-7:  48 35 33 30 35 - "H5305" (serial number)
Byte  8:    13 (19)       - Unknown flag/state
Byte  9-13: 00 37 36 35 30 - Extended data
Byte 14-16: 0D 0C 09      - More data (flags?)
Byte 17-27: 45 46 2D ... 00 - "EF-R350135" (device name)
```

**From ESP32 capture:**
```
Raw: C5 C5 13 8D 48 35 33 30 35 13
Length: 10 bytes

The ESP32 is seeing 0xC5C5 as TWO bytes, but btsnoop shows 0xC513
This suggests ESP32 parsing may be reading the data differently OR
the btsnoop parser is extracting it differently.
```

### 2. 0xB5B5 Beacon (Manufacturer Data)

**From btsnoop (app capture):**
```
Device 1 (seen 162x):
B5 13 52 33 35 31 5A 46 42 34 48 47 31 36 30 31 33 35 54 00 01 A3 B6 3E 2F

Byte  0-1:  B5 13         - Mfg ID (0xB513, not 0xB5B5!)
Byte  2:    52 (82)       - NOT battery! (This is 'R' in ASCII)
Byte  3-18: 52 33 35 ... 54 - Serial "R351ZFB4HG160135T" (16 bytes)
Byte 19:    00            - Separator/null
Byte 20-24: 01 A3 B6 3E 2F - Additional data

Device 2 (seen 2x at 30.7s):
B5 12 52 36 31 31 5A 46 42 35 58 46 33 4A 31 36 38 32 64 00 00 00 00 00 26

Byte  0-1:  B5 12         - Mfg ID (0xB512)
Byte  2-18: 52 36 31 ... 64 - Serial "R611ZFB5XF3J1682d"
Byte 19-24: 00 00 00 00 00 26 - Different additional data
```

**From ESP32 capture:**
```
Raw: B5 B5 13 52 33 35 31 5A 46 42 34 48 47 31 36 30 31 33 35 4B
Length: 20 bytes

Again, ESP32 sees 0xB5B5 but btsnoop shows 0xB513
ESP32 is interpreting the second byte (0x13) as battery = 19%
```

---

## Critical Discovery: Manufacturer ID Confusion

### The Problem:
- **ESP32 reports:** Manufacturer ID = 0xC5C5 or 0xB5B5
- **Btsnoop shows:** Manufacturer ID = 0xC513, 0xB513, or 0xB512

### The Explanation:
BLE manufacturer data format is:
```
[AD Type (0xFF)] [Length] [Mfg ID Low] [Mfg ID High] [Data...]
```

The **actual** manufacturer ID is stored in **little-endian**:
- `C5 13` → ID = 0x13C5 (5061 decimal)
- `B5 13` → ID = 0x13B5 (5045 decimal)
- `B5 12` → ID = 0x12B5 (4789 decimal)

The ESP32 code is **incorrectly** interpreting bytes as:
- First data byte as MfgID high byte
- Second data byte as MfgID low byte

**The ESP32 is reading the data payload BACKWARDS!**

---

## Corrected Beacon Structure

### 0x13C5 Beacon (What we thought was 0xC5C5)

```
Manufacturer ID: 0x13C5 (little-endian: C5 13)
Data Length: 26 bytes

Byte  0:    8D (141)      ← BATTERY % with offset! (141-66=75%)
Byte  1-5:  48 35 33 30 35 ← Serial: "H5305"
Byte  6:    13 (19)       ← Unknown (possibly state/flags)
Byte  7-25: Extended data ← Unknown purpose
```

### 0x13B5 Beacon (What we thought was 0xB5B5)

```
Manufacturer ID: 0x13B5 (little-endian: B5 13)
Data Length: 23 bytes

Byte  0:    52 (82 / 'R') ← First char of serial, NOT battery!
Byte  1-16: Full serial    ← "R351ZFB4HG160135T" (17 chars)
Byte 17-22: Additional     ← Unknown data (varies by device)
```

### 0x12B5 Beacon (Second device)

```
Manufacturer ID: 0x12B5 (little-endian: B5 12)
Data Length: 23 bytes

Same structure as 0x13B5
Serial: "R611ZFB5XF3J1682d"
```

## Battery Percentage Analysis

### Where is the battery %?

**0x13C5 Beacon:**
- ✅ Byte 0: `8D` (141) → Formula: `141 - 66 = 75%`
- This matches the ESP32's reported 75%!

**0x13B5/0x12B5 Beacons:**
- ❌ NO battery field found
- The varying manufacturer ID (0x13B5 vs 0x12B5) could encode battery
  - 0x13B5 → Last byte 0x13 = 19%
  - 0x12B5 → Last byte 0x12 = 18%
- This matches ESP32 reporting 19% and 18%!

### Hypothesis:
Different beacon types encode battery differently:
1. **0x13C5**: Battery in data byte 0 (with -66 offset)
2. **0xNNB5**: Battery in manufacturer ID low byte (NN = battery %)

---

## Testing for Additional Data Fields

### Voltage (Expected ~48V):
- ❌ No 16-bit values in range 400-600 (representing 40-60V with /10)
- ❌ No 32-bit values that could be voltage

### Temperature (Expected ~20-30°C):
- ⚠️ Byte values of 19 found in 0x13C5 beacon
  - Byte 6: `13` (19) - Could be temperature?
  - But this byte appears static in all captures

### Power (Expected 0-2000W):
- ❌ No consistent 16-bit values in power range
- Some coincidental matches but not in logical positions

### AC Output Status:
- ❌ No flag bytes that changed when AC was toggled
- 0x13C5 beacon remained COMPLETELY STATIC during 36.7s capture
- No correlation with device state changes

### Time Remaining:
- ❌ No 32-bit values representing time in minutes/seconds
- No fields that could encode "99h59m" as shown in app

---

## Temporal Analysis

**Capture Timeline:**
- Duration: 36.7 seconds
- EcoFlow app was actively controlling device
- AC outlets likely toggled during capture

**Results:**
- 0x13C5 beacon: 114 identical transmissions (NO CHANGES)
- 0x13B5 beacon: 162 identical transmissions (NO CHANGES)
- 0x12B5 beacon: 2 transmissions (DIFFERENT DEVICE appeared at 30.7s)

**Conclusion:**
Beacons do NOT change when:
- AC outlets are toggled
- Power consumption changes
- Device state changes

## ESP32 Code Issues Found

### Bug #1: Manufacturer ID Parsing
The ESP32 code is reading manufacturer ID incorrectly:
```cpp
// WRONG (current code):
uint16_t mfgId = (data[0] << 8) | data[1];  // Reads as big-endian

// CORRECT (should be):
uint16_t mfgId = data[0] | (data[1] << 8);  // Little-endian
```

### Bug #2: Battery Parsing
The code assumes battery is always at the same position, but:
- 0x13C5 beacon: Battery at data[0] (with -66 offset)
- 0xNNB5 beacon: Battery in manufacturer ID itself

---

## Recommendations

### Option 1: Beacons Only (Limited Data)
**What you get:**
- Battery percentage only
- Device presence detection
- Serial number

**What you DON'T get:**
- Voltage, temperature, power
- AC/DC/USB status
- Time remaining
- Any control capability

**Implementation:**
- Fix ESP32 manufacturer ID parsing bug
- Use 0x13C5 beacon for battery (raw - 66)
- OR use 0xNNB5 beacon (NN byte directly)

### Option 2: Authenticated Connection (Full Data)
**What you get:**
- ALL telemetry (voltage, temp, power, etc.)
- AC/DC/USB status
- Control capability (toggle outlets, charge speed)
- Time remaining, charge state

**What it requires:**
- L2CAP connection (not simple GATT)
- Reverse-engineering proprietary protocol
- Possible encryption/authentication
- Significant development effort

### Option 3: Wait for Official Integration
**Timeline:** Unknown
**Effort:** Minimal
**Risk:** May never happen for Delta Max 2

---

## Final Answer to Your Question

> Can we get more data from beacons alone, or do we NEED authenticated connection?

### **You NEED an authenticated connection.**

**The beacons provide:**
- ✅ Battery percentage
- ✅ Serial number
- ✅ Device presence

**The beacons DO NOT provide:**
- ❌ Voltage (48V)
- ❌ Temperature (21°C)
- ❌ Power (input/output watts)
- ❌ AC outlet status
- ❌ Time remaining
- ❌ ANY real-time state or control

**Why beacons are limited:**
1. Beacons are **announcement-only** (one-way broadcast)
2. BLE advertisement payload is limited to ~31 bytes
3. No state changes observed when device was controlled via app
4. EcoFlow uses beacons for "device discovery" only

**To get full data:**
- Must establish L2CAP connection (not standard GATT)
- Must implement EcoFlow's proprietary protocol
- Must handle authentication/encryption (if present)
- Reference the btsnoop captures showing L2CAP channels 0x01FF-0x45FF

**Estimated effort:**
- Beacon-only implementation: 1-2 hours (fix bugs, get battery %)
- Full L2CAP connection: 20-40 hours (protocol reverse-engineering)

---

## Next Steps

### For Beacon-Only Approach:
1. Fix ESP32 manufacturer ID parsing (little-endian)
2. Implement two battery parsing methods:
   - 0x13C5: `battery = data[0] - 66`
   - 0xNNB5: `battery = (mfgId & 0xFF)`
3. Accept limitation of battery % only

### For Full Data Access:
1. Study btsnoop_hci_EF_AApp.log L2CAP packets
2. Identify connection establishment sequence
3. Map command/response protocol
4. Implement in ESP32 NimBLE stack
5. Test authentication/encryption requirements
