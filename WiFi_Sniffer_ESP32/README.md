# WiFi Traffic Sniffer for EcoFlow Delta Max 2

## Purpose
Capture HTTP/TCP traffic from EcoFlow Delta Max 2 when connected to ESP32 Access Point to discover local API endpoints.

## How It Works

1. **ESP32 creates WiFi AP** named "PowerMonitor"
2. **EcoFlow connects** to this AP (via app settings)
3. **ESP32 logs ALL HTTP requests** from the EcoFlow
4. **Analyze** captured requests to find API structure

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Upload to ESP32
```bash
cd "C:\Trailer\CYD Build\WiFi_Sniffer_ESP32"
pio run --target upload
pio device monitor
```

### 2. Connect EcoFlow to AP

**Using EcoFlow App:**
1. Open EcoFlow app on phone
2. Make sure phone has mobile data or is near WiFi (for app to work)
3. Go to Settings ‚Üí WiFi (or similar)
4. Connect EcoFlow to WiFi network "PowerMonitor"
5. Password: `PowerMonitor123`

### 3. Watch Serial Monitor

You'll see:
- ‚úì When EcoFlow connects (with MAC and IP address)
- üì° All HTTP requests (method, URI, headers, body)
- Full request details logged

### 4. Test API Discovery

**Try these from EcoFlow app:**
- View battery status
- Toggle AC output ON/OFF
- Change settings

Each action should generate HTTP requests that we'll see!

## What We're Looking For

### Best Case:
```
üì° HTTP REQUEST RECEIVED!
Method: GET
URI: /api/status
Headers: ...
Response: {"battery": 84, "ac_output": true, ...}
```
= Simple JSON API! Easy to implement!

### Likely Case:
```
üì° HTTP REQUEST RECEIVED!
Method: POST
URI: /api/command
Body: [encrypted binary data]
```
= Encrypted API, need to analyze further

### Worst Case:
- No HTTP requests at all
- EcoFlow uses proprietary TCP protocol
- Would need TCP packet sniffer (more complex)

## Configuration

**AP Settings:**
- SSID: `PowerMonitor`
- Password: `PowerMonitor123`
- Channel: 1
- Max Clients: 4

**Change these in main.cpp if needed**

## Next Steps Based on Results

### If We See HTTP/JSON:
‚úÖ Implement local API client on Master ESP32
‚úÖ Parse JSON responses
‚úÖ Send commands via HTTP

### If We See Encrypted HTTP:
‚ö†Ô∏è Analyze encryption method
‚ö†Ô∏è Compare with BLE encryption
‚ö†Ô∏è Might still be easier than BLE

### If No HTTP Traffic:
‚ùå Try TCP packet capture (more advanced)
‚ùå Or fall back to BLE authentication method

## Troubleshooting

**EcoFlow won't connect:**
- Check password is correct (8+ chars required)
- Make sure ESP32 AP is visible
- Try forgetting network and reconnecting
- Check EcoFlow firmware supports WiFi

**No requests logged:**
- EcoFlow might need internet for app to work
- Try with phone on mobile data
- EcoFlow might not make local requests
- Check firewall/security settings

**ESP32 crashes:**
- Increase monitoring task stack size
- Disable debug logging if too verbose

## Technical Details

- **Web Server:** ESP32 AsyncWebServer on port 80
- **WiFi Mode:** AP (Access Point) mode
- **Logging:** All HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH)
- **Captures:** URI, headers, parameters, body

## Expected vs Actual

**What we HOPE to find:**
```
GET /api/status
Response: {"battery": 84, "power_in": 0, "power_out": 1, ...}

POST /api/ac_output
Body: {"enabled": true}
Response: {"success": true}
```

**What we might ACTUALLY find:**
```
POST /some/path
Body: [binary encrypted data]
Headers: X-Auth-Token: [something]
```

Either way, we'll learn something useful!
