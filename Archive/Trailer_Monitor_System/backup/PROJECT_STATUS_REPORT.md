# ESPHome Victron BLE Project - Status Report
**Date:** September 29, 2025  
**Time:** 4:00 PM

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY
1. **ESPHome Configuration Created**: Complete working configuration files
2. **External Component Integration**: Successfully integrated `github://Fabian-Schmidt/esphome-victron_ble`
3. **Device Configuration**: Added your specific Victron devices with MAC addresses
4. **Compilation Success**: Full ESP32 firmware compiled without errors (took 363 seconds initial build)
5. **Upload Success**: Firmware successfully uploaded to ESP32 on COM10
6. **Device Detection**: ESP32 is detecting both Victron devices via BLE

## üì± YOUR VICTRON DEVICES CONFIGURED
- **Shunt**: `c0:3b:98:39:e6:fe` with bindkey `8E85273557314E1EB83A94843D7C6265`
- **Solar**: `e8:86:01:5d:79:38` with bindkey `D04652F10B4C5AD5066E34E332AF6919`
- **WiFi**: Connected to "Rocket" network

## üîß CURRENT ISSUE IDENTIFIED
- **Bindkey Format**: ESP32 is reporting "Incorrect Bindkey" errors
  - Solar device expects bindkey starting with `D0` (we have uppercase now)
  - Shunt device expects bindkey starting with `8E` (we have uppercase now)
- **Status**: We corrected the case but need to upload the fix

## üìÅ FILES CREATED
1. `secrets.yaml` - Contains WiFi credentials and device bindkeys
2. `trailer_monitor.yaml` - Main ESP32 configuration (no display)
3. `trailer_cyd.yaml` - Future CYD display configuration
4. `TRAILER_SETUP.md` - Complete documentation and setup guide

## üõ†Ô∏è TECHNICAL DETAILS
- **ESPHome Version**: 2025.9.1
- **Platform**: ESP32 Arduino Framework 3.2.1
- **External Libraries**: AsyncTCP, ESPAsyncWebServer, ArduinoJson
- **Memory Usage**: RAM 18.6%, Flash 98.3%
- **ESP32 MAC**: 7c:87:ce:31:fe:50

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CURRENT CHALLENGE
- Need to safely upload corrected bindkeys without breaking system
- COM10 port is busy from existing monitoring session
- OTA update option available but failed previously

## üéØ NEXT STEPS NEEDED
1. Safely stop all monitoring processes
2. Upload corrected bindkey configuration
3. Verify Victron device authentication works
4. Test data reception from both devices

## üíæ BACKUP STATUS
All configuration files backed up to `backup/` folder with timestamps.
