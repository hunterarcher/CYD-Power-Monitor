## Configuration

Edit `src/config.h` to enable/disable modules:

```cpp
#define ENABLE_VICTRON_BLE 1  // Currently active
#define ENABLE_ECOFLOW 0      // Coming soon
#define ENABLE_TANK_MONITOR 0 // Coming soon
#define ENABLE_GAS_MONITOR 0  // Coming soon
#define ENABLE_FRIDGE 0       // In development
```

## Expected Serial Output

When working correctly, you should see:

```

## Troubleshooting

### Upload Issues
- **"Upload port not found"**
  - Check USB cable connection
  - Verify CP2102 driver is installed
  - Try different USB port
  - Check Device Manager for COM port

### Compilation Errors
- **"File not found"**
  - Ensure all files are in `src/` folder
  - Check file names match exactly
  
- **"Library not found"**
  - PlatformIO should auto-install libraries
  - Check `platformio.ini` has correct `lib_deps`

### BLE Connection Issues
- **"No Victron devices found"**
  - Ensure Victron device is powered on
  - Check device is within Bluetooth range (~10m)
  - Verify Bluetooth is enabled on Victron device
  - Some devices need to be woken up or accessed via app first

- **"Failed to connect to device"**
  - Device may be paired to another device (phone app)
  - Try power cycling the Victron device
  - Check if device appears in phone's BLE scanner

### Serial Monitor Issues
- **No output or garbage characters**
  - Check baud rate is set to 115200
  - Try pressing reset button on ESP32
  - Verify correct COM port is selected

## Development Workflow

### Fridge BLE Testing (Current Priority)
Based on last night's reverse engineering work, we've decoded the Flex Adventure fridge protocol:

**What we know:**
- **BLE Service:** `00001234-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb`
- **Notify Characteristic:** `00001236-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb`
- **Write Characteristic:** `00001235-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb`
- **Authentication:** Keep-alive frame `FEFE03010200` every 2 seconds
- **Command format:**
  - Left temp: `FEFE0405[temp]02[checksum]`
  - Right temp: `FEFE0406[temp]02[checksum]`
- **Status frames:** `FEFE21...` periodic notifications

**Today's Testing Plan:**
1. Upload ESP32 fridge test code (from last night's session)
2. Connect to fridge via BLE and enable notifications
3. Verify keep-alive maintains connection
4. Test temperature control commands
5. Decode status frame fields (temp, setpoint, battery mode, eco mode)
6. Log extended session to map all control functions

**Why ESP32 instead of nRF Connect:**
- Real-time hex dumps and logging
- No XML macro syntax issues
- Direct path to CYD integration
- Faster testing iteration (30 second cycles)
- Automated keep-alive prevents disconnections

### Adding a New Module

1. **Create header file** (`src/new_module.h`)
2. **Create implementation file** (`src/new_module.cpp`)
3. **Add enable flag to** `config.h`
4. **Include in** `main.cpp` with `#if ENABLE_NEW_MODULE`
5. **Test independently** before enabling other modules

### Testing a Module

1. Disable all other modules in `config.h`
2. Enable only the module you're testing
3. Build and upload
4. Monitor serial output for errors
5. Once stable, enable next module

### Fridge BLE Integration
**Last night's progress:**
- Successfully captured and decoded BLE communication via Wireshark
- Identified authentication pattern (2-second keep-alive)

4. Decode status notification fields
5. Document all control functions for display integration

**Testing commands via Serial Monitor:**
- `s` - Scan for fridge
- `c` - Connect and authenticate
- `left [temp]` - Set left compartment temperature
- `right [temp]` - Set right compartment temperature  
- `d` - Disconnect
