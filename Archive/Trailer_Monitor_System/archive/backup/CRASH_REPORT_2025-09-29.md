# CRITICAL ERROR LOG - ESP32 Crash
**Date:** September 29, 2025  
**Time:** 4:13 PM

## üö® SYSTEM CRASH DETECTED

### ERROR DETAILS:
```
abort() was called at PC 0x401ead33 on core 1
Backtrace: Memory allocation error in ArduinoJson library
Location: Web server JSON generation
```

### SUSPECTED CAUSE:
1. **Memory exhaustion** from continuous BLE scanning and bindkey errors
2. **Invalid bindkey format** causing excessive error logging  
3. **ArduinoJson memory allocation failure** during web server response

### CURRENT STATUS:
- ‚úÖ **Firmware compiled and uploaded successfully**
- ‚ùå **ESP32 crashed during runtime** 
- ‚ùå **Bindkey authentication still failing**
- ‚ùå **Memory leak in web server component**

### RECOVERY OPTIONS:

#### OPTION 1: SIMPLE RESTART
- Unplug ESP32 for 10 seconds
- Plug back in - may resolve temporary memory issue

#### OPTION 2: DISABLE WEB SERVER (SAFE MODE)
- Temporarily disable web server to reduce memory usage
- Focus on fixing bindkey issue first

#### OPTION 3: CHECK BINDKEY FORMAT
- Verify bindkey format matches Victron's expected format
- May need different encoding (hex vs binary)

#### OPTION 4: REDUCE BLE SCAN FREQUENCY  
- Lower BLE scanning rate to reduce memory pressure
- Add delays between scan attempts

### NEXT STEPS RECOMMENDED:
1. **IMMEDIATE**: Power cycle ESP32
2. **SHORT TERM**: Disable web server temporarily  
3. **LONG TERM**: Fix bindkey authentication to stop error flood

### BACKUP STATUS:
‚úÖ All configuration files backed up in `backup/` folder
‚úÖ Project status documented
‚úÖ No data loss - can restore to working state
