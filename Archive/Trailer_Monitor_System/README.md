## Setup Instructions

### 1. Configure Device MAC Addresses

Both ESP32s need to know each other's MAC addresses for ESP-NOW communication.

**Find your ESP32 MAC addresses:**
```cpp
#include <WiFi.h>
void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  WiFi.mode(WIFI_STA);
  Serial.println(WiFi.macAddress());
}
```

**Update the MAC addresses in the code:**

In `victron_sensor/src/main.cpp`:
```cpp
uint8_t mainDisplayMAC[] = {0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF}; // Replace with actual MAC
```

### 2. Configure Your Victron Device MAC Addresses

In `victron_sensor/include/victron_ble.h`, update the MAC addresses with your actual devices:
```cpp
#define BMV712_MAC "C0:3B:98:39:E6:FE"  // Your BMV-712 MAC
#define MPPT_MAC "E8:86:01:5D:79:38"    // Your MPPT MAC  
#define IP22_MAC "C7:A2:C2:61:9F:C4"    // Your IP22 MAC
```

### 3. Configure WiFi (Main Display Only)

In `main_display/src/main.cpp`:
```cpp
const char* WIFI_SSID = "YourWiFiSSID";
const char* WIFI_PASSWORD = "YourWiFiPassword";
```

### 4. Hardware Connections

**Main Display ESP32 + OLED:**
```
ESP32    SSD1306
-----    -------
3.3V  -> VCC
GND   -> GND
GPIO21 -> SDA
GPIO22 -> SCL
```

### 5. Build and Upload

**Victron Sensor ESP32:**
```bash
cd victron_sensor
pio run -t upload
pio device monitor
```

**Main Display ESP32:**
```bash
cd main_display  
pio run -t upload
pio device monitor
```

## Usage

### Serial Monitor Output

**Victron Sensor:**
```
=== Victron BLE Sensor ESP32 ===
‚úì ESP-NOW initialized
‚úì BLE scanning started
Found Victron device: C0:3B:98:39:E6:FE (RSSI: -45)
‚úì Instant readout packet found
Parsed: 12.85V, -15.2A, -195.3W, 87% SOC
‚úì Data sent successfully
```

**Main Display:**
```
=== Victron Main Display ESP32 ===
‚úì WiFi connected! IP: 192.168.1.100
‚úì ESP-NOW receiver initialized
‚úì Web server started
Received data from device type 1: 12.85V, -15.20A
```

### Web Interface

Connect to the main display's IP address in your browser:
- **Local Network**: `http://192.168.1.100` (actual IP shown in serial)
- **AP Mode**: `http://192.168.4.1` (if WiFi fails)

### OLED Display

The main display shows real-time data on the connected OLED:
```
Victron Monitor
---------------
BMV: 12.8V -15.2A
SOC: 87% PWR:-195W

MPPT: 14.2V 8.5A  
Solar: 121W

IP22: 13.6V 5.2A
```

## Victron Device Data

The system monitors these Victron BLE advertisements:

### BMV-712 (Battery Monitor)
- Battery voltage
- Battery current (+ charging, - discharging)
- State of Charge (SOC %)
- Power calculation

### MPPT Solar Controller
- PV panel voltage
- PV current
- Solar power generation

### IP22 Charger
- Charger output voltage
- Charger current
- Charging power

## Troubleshooting

### No BLE Data Received
1. **Check MAC addresses** in `victron_ble.h` match your devices exactly
2. **BLE range**: Ensure sensor ESP32 is within ~10m of Victron devices
3. **Enable BLE** on Victron devices (usually automatic with VictronConnect app usage)
4. **Monitor serial output** for BLE scan results

### ESP-NOW Communication Issues
1. **Verify MAC addresses** between both ESP32s are correct
2. **Check power supply** - unstable power can cause communication failures
3. **WiFi channel conflicts** - ESP-NOW uses same channels as WiFi
4. **Distance**: Keep ESP32s within ~100m line-of-sight

### Memory Issues
1. **Use provided platformio.ini** files - they're optimized for each ESP32's role
2. **Monitor serial output** for memory warnings during compilation
3. **Reduce library dependencies** if adding features

### Display Issues
1. **Check I2C wiring** (SDA/SCL connections)
2. **Verify OLED address** (usually 0x3C or 0x3D)
3. **Power supply**: OLED requires stable 3.3V

## Memory Usage

Both ESP32 projects are optimized for their specific roles:

**Victron Sensor**: ~50% flash usage (BLE + ESP-NOW only)
**Main Display**: ~75% flash usage (WiFi + Web server + Display + ESP-NOW)

## Supported Victron Devices

This system uses the Victron Instant Readout BLE protocol. Confirmed working devices:
- BMV-712 Smart Battery Monitor
- SmartSolar MPPT controllers  
- Phoenix IP22 Smart Chargers
- Most Victron devices with BLE capability

## Development Notes

### Based on Working ESPHome/HACS Integration

This implementation is designed to replicate the functionality of your working Home Assistant setup:
- Uses same BLE scanning approach as ESPHome Bluetooth Proxy
- Parses Victron Instant Readout protocol like HACS integration
- Maintains the same data accuracy and reliability

### Why ESP-NOW vs WiFi?

ESP-NOW provides several advantages for this application:
- **Lower latency**: Direct device communication without router/network stack
- **More reliable**: No dependency on WiFi network stability  
- **Lower power**: More efficient than full TCP/IP stack
- **Simpler setup**: No network configuration needed between devices

### Future Enhancements

- Battery-powered sensor nodes with deep sleep
- Multiple sensor ESP32s for larger installations
- MQTT integration for Home Assistant
- Historical data logging
- Solar production forecasting
- Alert system for low battery/charging issues
