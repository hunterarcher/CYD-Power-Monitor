# Home Assistant to Standalone ESPHome Migration Plan
*Created: 2025-09-29 - Converting working HA setup to standalone ESPHome*

## ðŸŽ¯ OBJECTIVE
Replicate your working Home Assistant + HACS + Bluetooth Proxy system as a standalone ESPHome configuration that doesn't require Home Assistant.

## ðŸ“Š DATA COLLECTION NEEDED

### 1. Home Assistant Configuration Data
**Please provide the following from your working HA setup:**

#### A. HACS Victron Integration Details
```bash
# In HA, go to: Settings â†’ Devices & Services â†’ Integrations
# Find your Victron integration and provide:
- Integration name/type
- Device names and entities
- Configuration parameters
- Any custom settings
```

#### B. Bluetooth Proxy Configuration
```bash
# From your ESP32 Bluetooth Proxy ESPHome config:
# Go to: Settings â†’ Add-ons â†’ ESPHome â†’ Your Proxy Device â†’ Edit
# Copy the YAML configuration (especially bluetooth_proxy section)
```

#### C. Entity Information
```bash
# Go to: Developer Tools â†’ States
# Search for "victron" or your device names
# Provide entity IDs and current values like:
- sensor.victron_battery_voltage
- sensor.victron_solar_power  
- sensor.victron_current
# etc.
```

#### D. Device Information
```bash
# Go to: Settings â†’ Devices & Services â†’ Devices
# Find your Victron devices and note:
- Device names
- MAC addresses (should match what we have)
- Available entities/sensors
- Device model information
```

### 2. Network Connectivity Confirmation
âœ… **AC Connected**: You mentioned it works when closer (signal strength dependent)
âœ… **Bluetooth Working**: HA successfully reads Victron devices
âœ… **ESP32 Proxy**: Currently functioning as BT proxy for HA

### 3. Key Questions for Replication

#### A. Sensor Data Scope
- What specific Victron data are you successfully reading in HA?
- Which sensors are most critical for your monitoring?
- Any calculated/derived sensors (like power calculations)?

#### B. Data Handling
- Do you need local data logging on the ESP32?
- Should it serve a web interface for local access?
- Any alerts/notifications needed?
- Data export requirements?

#### C. Update Frequency
- How often does HA update the Victron data?
- Any real-time requirements?
- Battery optimization needs?

## ðŸ”§ CONVERSION STRATEGY

### Phase 1: Extract Working Config
1. Get your HA Bluetooth proxy ESPHome YAML
2. Identify successful Victron BLE connection parameters
3. Map HA entities to standalone sensors

### Phase 2: Standalone ESPHome Design
1. Convert bluetooth_proxy to direct victron_ble integration
2. Add local web server for data access
3. Implement local data logging if needed
4. Add WiFi fallback and reconnection logic

### Phase 3: Memory Optimization
1. Remove unnecessary HA integration features
2. Optimize sensor update intervals
3. Minimize web server memory usage
4. Add heap monitoring

## ðŸ“‹ DATA TO COLLECT NOW

**Please provide:**

1. **Your working Bluetooth Proxy ESPHome YAML** (from HA ESPHome dashboard)
2. **List of Victron entities** working in HA (from Developer Tools â†’ States)
3. **Device information** from HA Devices page
4. **HACS integration name** and version you're using
5. **Any custom automations** or calculations using Victron data

## ðŸŽ¯ END GOAL
A standalone ESP32 that:
- âœ… Connects directly to Victron devices via BLE
- âœ… Serves local web interface for monitoring
- âœ… Logs data locally (optional)
- âœ… Works without Home Assistant dependency
- âœ… Optimized memory usage (no crashes)
- âœ… Reliable reconnection handling
