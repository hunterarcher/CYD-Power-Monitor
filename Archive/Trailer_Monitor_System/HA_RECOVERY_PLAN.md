# Home Assistant ESPHome Recovery Plan
*Created: 2025-09-29 - After ESP32 crash and bindkey failures*

## IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED
ðŸš¨ **UNPLUG ESP32 NOW** to stop crash loop and prevent damage

## Why Home Assistant ESPHome Dashboard?
- Better error visibility and debugging
- Real-time compilation feedback
- Web-based configuration validation
- Built-in device discovery
- Automatic backup management
- Superior log analysis tools

## Step-by-Step Recovery Process

### Step 1: Access Home Assistant ESPHome
1. Open Home Assistant in your browser
2. Go to Settings â†’ Add-ons â†’ ESPHome
3. Click "Open Web UI"

### Step 2: Import Our Configuration
1. Click "New Device" â†’ "Continue" â†’ "Skip" (we have config)
2. Name it: `trailer-monitor`
3. Replace default config with our `trailer_monitor.yaml` content

### Step 3: Critical Files to Copy
- **secrets.yaml** (our WiFi and bindkey data)
- **trailer_monitor.yaml** (main configuration)

### Step 4: HA ESPHome Advantages
- **Validation**: Real-time syntax checking
- **Logs**: Better formatted error messages  
- **OTA**: Safer over-the-air updates
- **Debugging**: Step-by-step compilation visibility
- **Recovery**: Built-in rollback capabilities

## Current Issue Analysis
Based on our crash logs, the problems are:

### 1. Bindkey Authentication Failing
```
[C0:3B:98:39:E6:FE] Incorrect Bindkey. Must start with 8E
[E8:86:01:5D:79:38] Incorrect Bindkey. Must start with D0
```

### 2. Memory Crash in ArduinoJson
```
abort() was called at PC 0x401ead33 on core 1
Memory allocation failure in web server JSON generation
```

## Home Assistant Will Help Us:
1. **Validate bindkey format** - HA often shows clearer error messages
2. **Memory optimization** - HA's ESPHome build might handle memory better
3. **Step-by-step debugging** - See exactly where compilation/runtime fails
4. **Safe testing** - Better recovery options if things go wrong

## Next Steps After HA Setup:
1. Upload through HA ESPHome dashboard
2. Monitor logs through HA interface
3. Test bindkey authentication
4. Optimize memory usage if needed
5. Verify Victron device detection

## Backup Status
âœ… All files backed up in `backup/` folder with timestamp
âœ… Crash report documented
âœ… Configuration preserved

## Recovery Options Available:
- **Option A**: Continue with HA ESPHome (RECOMMENDED)
- **Option B**: Disable web server to reduce memory usage
- **Option C**: Investigate Victron BLE component requirements
- **Option D**: Rollback to original PlatformIO setup
