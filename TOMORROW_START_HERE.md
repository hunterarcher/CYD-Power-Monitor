## WHERE WE LEFT OFF

### The Good News ‚úÖ
We **proved ESP-NOW bidirectional works** with a clean test:
- Test_ESP_NOW_Master + Test_ESP_NOW_Slave = **100% success both directions**
- Master ‚Üí Victron receives perfectly (all 5 devices including fridge temps)
- Web server fast and responsive

### The Problem ‚ùå
**BLE scanning blocks ESP-NOW receive callbacks on Victron_ESP32**

When Master sends fridge control commands:
```
[Control] Set left temp to 5¬∞C - ‚úì Sent
[ESP-NOW] Send status: ‚úó Failed  ‚Üê Callback shows failed
```

Victron serial shows:
- **NO** receive callback triggered
- Stuck in BLE scan
- `victron.scan(0.5)` crashes: "Starting 0 second scan..." then stalls

---

## THE FIX TO TRY FIRST

### Change Victron_ESP32 Loop to Timed Scanning

Instead of scanning every loop, scan every 5 seconds:

```cpp
unsigned long lastVictronScan = 0;
unsigned long lastEcoFlowScan = 0;
const unsigned long SCAN_INTERVAL = 5000;  // 5 seconds

void loop() {
    unsigned long now = millis();

    // Only scan every 5 seconds
    if (now - lastVictronScan > SCAN_INTERVAL) {
        victron.scan(1);  // 1 second scan
        lastVictronScan = now;
        yield();
    }

    if (now - lastEcoFlowScan > SCAN_INTERVAL + 2000) {
        scanEcoFlow();
        lastEcoFlowScan = now;
        yield();
    }

    // Fridge keep-alive (already time-gated)
    if (fridgeConnected && (now - lastFridgeKeepAlive >= FRIDGE_KEEPALIVE_INTERVAL)) {
        if (pFridgeWrite) {
            pFridgeWrite->writeValue((uint8_t*)FRIDGE_KEEPALIVE, 6, true);
            lastFridgeKeepAlive = now;
        }
    }

    // Prepare and send ESP-NOW packet
    [... existing packet prep code ...]

    yield();  // Critical: Free time for ESP-NOW
}
```

**Why this will work:**
- Gives **4 seconds of free time** between scans
- ESP-NOW receive callbacks can fire during yield()
- Still updates device data every 5 seconds (plenty fast)

## EXACT NEXT STEPS

1. Open `C:\Trailer\CYD Build\Victron_ESP32\src\main.cpp`

2. Find the loop() function (line ~425)

3. Replace the immediate BLE scans with timed scans (code above)

4. Upload to Victron ESP32

5. Upload Master_ESP32 to CYD (no changes needed)

6. Test:
   - Connect phone to "PowerMonitor" WiFi
   - Browse to http://192.168.4.1
   - Click fridge card
   - Adjust temperature sliders
   - Watch Victron serial for "*** RECEIVE CALLBACK TRIGGERED ***"

7. If it works:
   - Fridge temp should change
   - Both serials show success
   - üéâ Project complete!

8. If it still fails:
   - Increase SCAN_INTERVAL to 10000 (10 seconds)
   - Or try FreeRTOS task separation
   - Or consider separate ESP32 for BLE

## KEY DISCOVERIES (Don't Forget!)

1. **WIFI_AP_STA is mandatory** for Master with web server
2. **Channel 1 explicit config** works best
3. **yield() not delay(10)** for responsive web
4. **BLE scan blocks ESP-NOW** - this is the root cause
5. **0.5 second scans crash** - use integers (1 second minimum)

## DEVICE INFO

| Device | MAC | Mode | Channel |
|--------|-----|------|---------|
| Master_ESP32 (CYD) | 7C:87:CE:31:FE:50 | AP_STA | 1 |
| Victron_ESP32 | 78:21:84:9C:9B:88 | STA | 1 |

**Web Access:** http://192.168.4.1 (after connecting to "PowerMonitor")

## IF YOU NEED TO START FRESH

The working test code is in:
- `Test_ESP_NOW_Master/src/main.cpp`
- `Test_ESP_NOW_Slave/src/main.cpp`

These have NO BLE, just pure ESP-NOW + web server. Start here if you need to debug further.

**Good luck tomorrow! The breakthrough is done, just need to fix the BLE blocking issue. üöÄ**
