## 📐 MPU-6050 Leveling System (New Feature)

### Research Phase
- [ ] Review MPU-6050 specifications
- [ ] Check I2C pin availability on Master ESP32
- [ ] Research ESP32 MPU-6050 libraries (Adafruit? MPU6050_light?)
- [ ] Understand calibration requirements
- [ ] Review pitch/roll calculations

### Hardware Planning
- [ ] Order MPU-6050 module (if not available)
- [ ] Plan wiring to Master ESP32:
  - VCC → 3.3V
  - GND → GND
  - SDA → GPIO 21 (default I2C)
  - SCL → GPIO 22 (default I2C)
- [ ] Consider mounting location on trailer
  - Rigid mounting point
  - Protected from weather
  - Accessible for calibration
  - Account for trailer flex

### Software Design

  - Visual bubble level graphic
  - Real-time pitch/roll angles
  - Color-coded indicators (green=level, yellow/red=tilted)
  - Front/Back tilt indicator
  - Left/Right tilt indicator
  - Calibrate button
- [ ] Plan data structure for MPU-6050 readings
- [ ] Plan calibration workflow
  - Save "zero" position to SPIFFS
  - Reset calibration option
  - Calibration instructions on page

### Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Add MPU-6050 library to Master_ESP32/platformio.ini
- [ ] Create I2C initialization code

- [ ] Implement calibration save/load to SPIFFS
- [ ] Add link to leveling page on main dashboard
- [ ] Test with actual sensor mounted

## ✅ Documentation Updates - COMPLETED!
- [x] **UPDATED**: INVENTORY_SYSTEM.md with 3-level structure ✓

- [ ] Any other issues discovered during testing

## 💡 Nice-to-Have Ideas (Backlog)
- [ ] Add battery level indicator for Master ESP32 itself
- [ ] Add temperature sensor to Master (ambient temp)
- [ ] Create settings page for WiFi credentials
- [ ] Add ability to export/import inventory as JSON file
- [ ] Night mode toggle for dashboard
