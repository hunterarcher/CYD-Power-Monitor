# Session Summary - Fridge BLE Integration

**Date:** October 2, 2025
**Duration:** Full day development session
**Status:** ✅ Temperature control working perfectly, ECO/Battery commands identified but not functional

---

## What Was Accomplished Today

### 1. Complete Fridge BLE Integration
- **Victron ESP32** now connects to Flex Adventure Camping Fridge via BLE
- Reads temperature data from both LEFT (fridge) and RIGHT (freezer) compartments
- Maintains stable connection with keep-alive frames every 2 seconds
- Parses notification frames to extract temps, setpoints, ECO mode, battery protection

### 2. Bidirectional Command System
- **Master ESP32** sends commands via ESP-NOW to **Victron ESP32**
- Victron executes commands on fridge via BLE writes
- ACK (acknowledgment) system confirms command receipt and execution
- Command queue handles multiple requests and waits for ready state

### 3. Web Interface for Fridge Control
- **Main page** (`/`) shows summary of all devices including fridge temps
- **Fridge control page** (`/fridge`) allows temperature adjustment
- Multi-increment buttons: -5, -1, +1, +5 for quick changes
- JavaScript accumulation - click multiple times before sending
- Manual refresh button (no auto-refresh to prevent interrupt)
- UTF-8 encoding fixes degree symbol display

### 4. Critical Bug Fixes

#### Issue 1: Wrong MAC Address
**Problem:** Code was connecting to `fc:67:1f:f0:4e:cb` but fridge is at `ff:ff:11:c6:29:50`
**Solution:** Updated `FRIDGE_MAC` to correct address
**Lesson:** Always verify MAC addresses match between test code and production

#### Issue 2: Wrong Zone Codes
**Problem:** Using zones `0x01` (LEFT) and `0x02` (RIGHT) but fridge expects `0x05` and `0x06`
**Solution:** Changed zone codes to match working test
**Discovery:** Bluetooth snoop logs and working test code showed actual zone values
**Result:** Temperature commands now work perfectly

#### Issue 3: Service Discovery Timing
**Problem:** `getService()` returned NULL - services not discovered yet
**Root Cause:** WiFi/ESP-NOW initialization before BLE, plus insufficient delay
**Solution:** Removed premature `getServices()` call, added proper delays matching working test
**Key Insight:** The working test goes directly to `getService()` without calling `getServices()` first

#### Issue 4: ECO Mode Byte Mapping
**Problem:** ECO mode showing opposite state (ON when OFF, OFF when ON)
**Discovery:** Notification bytes and command bytes use DIFFERENT mappings!
- **Notification parsing:** `0x01 = ON`, `0x00 = OFF`
- **Command sending:** `0x00 = ON`, `0x01 = OFF`
**Solution:** Inverted notification parsing, kept command bytes matching working test
**Lesson:** Don't assume bidirectional protocols use the same encoding!

## Technical Discoveries

### BLE Protocol Reverse Engineering

#### Frame Types (from Bluetooth snoop analysis)
```
0x03 - Keep-alive frame (6 bytes)
0x21 - Status notification (20 bytes) - Contains temps, ECO, battery
0x04 - Temperature command (7 bytes)
0x1C - Settings command (20 bytes) - ECO and battery protection
```

#### Temperature Command Structure
```
[0] [1] [2] [3]   [4]    [5] [6]
FE  FE  04  ZONE  TEMP   02  CHECKSUM

Zone: 0x05 = LEFT, 0x06 = RIGHT
Temp: Signed int8 (-20 to +20°C)
Checksum: Sum of bytes [0] to [5], minus 6
```

#### Settings Command Structure (ECO/Battery)
```
[0] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6]  [7]      [8-19]
FE  FE  1C  02  00  01  ECO  BATTERY  0314EC020000FDFDFD00F100

ECO: 0x00 = ON, 0x01 = OFF
Battery: 0x00 = L (8.5V), 0x01 = M (10.1V), 0x02 = H (11.1V)
```

### ESP-NOW Command Flow
```
1. Web UI button click
   ↓
2. Master ESP32 queues command
   ↓
3. Master waits for "READY" status from Victron
   ↓
4. Master sends ControlCommand via ESP-NOW
   ↓
5. Victron receives, queues, sends ACK (received=true, executed=false)
   ↓
6. Victron executes BLE write to fridge
   ↓
7. Victron sends ACK (executed=true)
   ↓
8. Fridge processes command (1-2 seconds)
   ↓
9. Fridge sends notification with updated values
   ↓
10. Victron parses notification, includes in next VictronPacket
   ↓
11. Master displays updated values on web page
```

## Known Issues & Limitations

### ✅ Working Features
- ✅ Temperature control (LEFT & RIGHT zones)
- ✅ Real-time temperature display
- ✅ Setpoint display
- ✅ ECO mode **reading** (displays correctly)
- ✅ Battery protection **reading** (displays correctly)
- ✅ BLE connection stability
- ✅ ESP-NOW bidirectional communication
- ✅ Command queue and ACK system

### ⚠️ Non-Working Features
- ❌ ECO mode **control** - Commands sent correctly but fridge ignores them
- ❌ Battery protection **control** - Commands sent correctly but fridge ignores them

**Why ECO/Battery don't work:**
1. Commands match Bluetooth snoop log exactly
2. ACK confirms command was written to BLE characteristic
3. Fridge receives the write (no BLE errors)
4. But notifications continue showing old values
5. Working test code only tested temperature changes, not ECO/Battery
6. May require:
   - Specific fridge state/conditions
   - Additional validation/checksum we haven't discovered
   - Different fridge firmware version
   - Different BLE characteristic for settings

## Code Highlights

### Fridge Connection Sequence (Victron ESP32)
```cpp
1. Scan for 10 seconds
2. Find fridge by MAC: ff:ff:11:c6:29:50
3. Create BLE client, set callbacks
4. Connect with 5 retries (200ms between)
5. Wait 1000ms for stabilization
6. Get service: 00001234-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb
7. Get characteristics:
   - Write:  00001235-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb
   - Notify: 00001236-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb
8. Enable notifications (CCCD write 0x0100)
9. Send first keep-alive
10. Start 2-second keep-alive timer
```

### Temperature Command (Victron ESP32)
```cpp
bool setFridgeTemperature(int8_t temp, uint8_t zone) {
    uint8_t cmd[7] = {
        0xFE, 0xFE, 0x04, zone, (uint8_t)temp, 0x02, 0x00
    };
    cmd[6] = calculateChecksum(cmd, 6);  // Sum - 6
    pFridgeWrite->writeValue(cmd, 7, true);
    return true;
}
```

### Web UI Multi-Increment (Master ESP32)
```javascript
var leftTarget = 4;  // Initialize from server
function updateLeft(delta) {
    leftTarget += delta;
    if (leftTarget < -20) leftTarget = -20;
    if (leftTarget > 20) leftTarget = 20;
    document.getElementById('leftTarget').innerText = leftTarget + '°C';
}
function setLeft() {
    location.href = '/fridge/cmd?zone=0&temp=' + leftTarget;
}
```

## Lessons Learned

### 1. BLE Debugging Best Practices
- ✅ Use Bluetooth snoop logs to capture real app behavior
- ✅ Compare working test code byte-by-byte
- ✅ Add debug output for every byte sent/received
- ✅ Don't assume protocols are symmetric (notification ≠ command)
- ✅ MAC addresses and UUIDs must match exactly

### 2. ESP32 BLE/WiFi Coexistence
- ⚠️ WiFi initialization can interfere with BLE service discovery
- ✅ Follow exact timing from working test code
- ✅ Don't add "optimizations" like calling getServices() first
- ✅ Clear BLE scan cache before each scan

### 3. Web UI Design for IoT
- ✅ Avoid auto-refresh when user might be making changes
- ✅ Use JavaScript for local state before sending commands
- ✅ UTF-8 encoding essential for special characters
- ✅ Manual refresh button gives user control
- ✅ Clickable cards better than small buttons on mobile

### 4. Command Queue Architecture
- ✅ Master and Victron both need queues (different purposes)
- ✅ Wait for READY status before sending commands
- ✅ ACK system provides confidence commands were executed
- ✅ Throttle commands (100ms minimum between sends)
